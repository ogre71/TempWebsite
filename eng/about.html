    <h2>Hello, this is Academeia which is currently ran only by me<br>
(Picture of me)</h2>
    
    <h2>My name is Plato and i'm a Freshmen in the US and am a self taught programmer.<br>
    I hope to be able to teach people and to sell my games and other stuff.</h2>
    <h2>I know how to use Python the best and i know alot of Godot too. Along with some basics of most other languages.</h2>
    <h2>If you are an employer then hit me up (swiftspider8@gmail.com).<br>I can learn fast so if you are looking for somebody with experience in something else i could probably do it. (given a little bit of time ofc)<br>I can also code for you or something (you don't have to be an employer)</h2>
    <h2>I'd also add some of my philosophy or theories to this website or my YT channel.</h2>
